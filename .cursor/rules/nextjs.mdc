# Guidelines
## 1. Expertise in Next.js
- **Language & Comments:** Ensure all code (function names, variables, comments) is in English.
- **Architecture:** Follow component-based architecture, keeping logic and UI separation clearly defined.

## 2. Project Structure and Modules
- **Folder Organization:** Maintain clear separation of components, pages, and API routes.
- **Modular Code:** Divide the project into modules addressing different functionalities such as authentication, marketplace, projects, etc.

## 3. Code Clarity and Reusability
- **Reusability:** Write components that are modular and reusable. Avoid repetition by abstracting common logic.
- **Best Practices:** Utilize early returns, proper state management, and error handling as needed.

## 4. Testing and Documentation
- **Testing:** Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
- **Documentation:** Document complex logic and design decisions in English to aid future maintenance.
